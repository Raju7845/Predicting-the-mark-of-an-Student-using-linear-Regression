Overview:
This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model using Python and Scikit-Learn to make predictions. Given an input of study hours, the model predicts the expected score for a student. This project is ideal for beginners in machine learning who want to understand the basic workflow of building, training, and testing a regression model.
Dataaset
The dataset (`student_scores.csv`) used in this project includes two columns:
- `Hours`: The number of hours a student studied.
- `Score`: The score achieved by the student.

Sample data:
| Hours | Score |
|-------|-------|
| 1.5   | 20    |
| 3.0   | 30    |
| 4.5   | 42    |
| 6.0   | 60    |
| 8.0   | 80    |

Code Explanation
1. Importing Libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
Pandas is used to load and manage the dataset.
NumPy assists in numerical operations.
LinearRegression from Scikit-Learn builds and trains the model.
Matplotlib is used for data visualization.

2. Loading the Dataset
The CSV file student_scores.csv is loaded into a DataFrame.
data = pd.read_csv('student_scores.csv')

3. Training the Model
We use hours studied (Hours) as the independent variable (feature) and scores (Score) as the dependent variable (target).
X = data[['Hours']]
y = data['Score']
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

4. Visualizing the Data and Model
A scatter plot visualizes the data points, and the regression line represents the modelâ€™s predictions:
plt.scatter(X, y, color='blue')
plt.plot(X, model.predict(X), color='red')
plt.show()

5. Making Predictions
The program prompts the user to input the number of hours they studied and then predicts the score using the trained model.
hours = float(input("Enter the number of hours you studied: "))
predicted_score = model.predict([[hours]])

Results
After training, the model will provide accurate predictions based on the input hours. The regression line plotted on the graph demonstrates the linear relationship between study hours and student scores. This example shows how machine learning can be used to make data-driven predictions.
